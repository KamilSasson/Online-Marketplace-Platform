E-commerce Marketplace System

Overview
  This project is a collaborative effort developed as part of our studies,   aiming to create an E-commerce Marketplace System.
  inspired by platforms like Amazon and AliExpress. It enables sellers to   list products, buyers to purchase them, 
  and provides tools for managing inventory and orders.

Features

  1.User Roles:
   * Buyers can browse products, manage a shopping cart, and place orders.
   * Sellers can add products and manage their inventory.
   * Admin Tools: Manage users and monitor platform activity.

  2.Product Management:
   * Multiple categories including Clothing, Electronics, Office Supplies, and more.
   * Dynamic product addition and real-time inventory updates.

  3.Order Processing:
   * Secure payment simulation and order history management.

  4.Interactive Console Interface:
   * User-friendly menu navigation for buyers, sellers, and admins.

Technologies
   * Programming Language: Java
   * Object-Oriented Design: Clear separation of concerns using classes like Buyer, Seller, Product, and Order.
   * Data Structures: Arrays for storing users and products with resizing capabilities for scalability.

Team Contribution
This project was developed by a team of three(that ia am one of them),       focusing on collaboration, code reviews, and iterative improvements:
my partners:Amit Garfel and Dan Swirsky.
Each team member contributed to different parts of the system, including     architecture, coding, testing, and debugging.

Class Diagram
The system's structure follows a well-defined hierarchy, as illustrated in   the provided diagram (see diagram.pdf for details).
